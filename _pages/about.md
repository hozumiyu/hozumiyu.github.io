I am currently a Hale Visiting Assistant Professor at the [School of Mathematics](https://math.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Tecnology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working with Prof. [Christine E. Heitsch](https://ceheitsch.github.io/webpage/) on RNA secondary structure prediction. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Michigan State University under the supervision of Prof. Guo-Wei Wei.

My methodological research focuses on the development of mathematical tools for analyzing genome data, including RNA molecules, proteins, single cell RNA sequencing, etc. In Single cell RNA sequencing, I develop dimensionality reduction methods for downstream analysis, such as trajectory analysis, cell-cell interaction and differential gene expression. In genomic analysis, I am integrating topological data analysis tools to analyze the shape of the DNA sequences. I have recently begin utilizing applied combinatorics to determine consensus secondary RNA structure from homologous RNA structures.

## Research Interests
* DNA/RNA sequence analysis
* Single Cell Omics Data
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Data Visualization
* Computational Topology and Geometry
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Recent/Upcoming Events
10/21/2024-10/25-2024: I am attending the SIAM Mathemtics of Data Science in Atlanta. I will have a poster on Tuesday and Wedensday. I am also hosting a session titled [Integrating Topological Data Analysis and Data Science with Biological Applications](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=80565)

10/01/2024: I recently had my paper titled CCP-assisted UMAP and tSNE for scRNA-seq data analyis in PLOS ONE
